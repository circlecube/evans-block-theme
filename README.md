# Evan's Block Theme
My own block theme for my own [site](https://evanmullins.com)!

## Overview
This theme is loosley based on the visual layout of the eleven year old classic twentyeleven, but block-based to take advantage of the full site editing advancements and capabilities of modern WordPress.

This was built as a personal block and block theme playground for myself as well as to share what I learn. There are examples of how to do things in a few different ways, as well as being a simply organized example of a block based theme with modular code that is supported with a simple webpack build to combine it all. 

## Theme Features:
- A theme.json file listing default styles. 
- Webpack build script for mulitple blocks
- Block template parts for header, footer, and social etc.
- Block variations with styles for a resume experience block.
- Block styles for a resume skills list block.
- Block for a talk block to list speaking experience.
- Block for a resume skills block featureing nested repeatable blocks.

## Still in the works:
- More custom blocks for fun.
- More Custom block styles for fun.
- A link tree type block and template?
