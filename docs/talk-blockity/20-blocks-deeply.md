# Blocks Deeply

Go Forth and make Great Blockity McBlockin’ Blocks!
Blocks are here to stay – understanding them deeply will pay off, 
plus they’re fun!

I agree, it’s tricky to stay up to date with something that is under constant development, but it’s important to understand the big picture at least so you know the tools you have at your disposal. There are many different ways to achieve many very similar outcomes when dealing with custom blocks. We have patterns and variations and templates and each could be used to achieve similar goals but each has a strength and weakness that we can examine with experimentation and familiarity. 

My goal here isn't to expose all these strengths and weaknesses in each situation here, but to give a high level perspective on what all the current options are for blocks. Knowing the basics on all fronts may help us save time and use a better tool for a specific job we have in mind.
