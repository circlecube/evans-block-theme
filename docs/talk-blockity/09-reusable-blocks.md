# Reusable Blocks

We can save a block (or group of blocks) to be used in multiple placed on a site. 

Reusable blocks are blocks with identical contents that are used in multiple places on a site. This is an end-user feature (rather than developer focused). For example, if you have a blurb at the end of every blog post, you can include it and manage the content globally from one place. If you make an edit to a reusable block, the edits will affect every instance of that block.
