## The Case For A Personal Site

### Do you have a personal website?
Chances are you may have a site already. Sadly, many links I follow to personal sites end with a 404. Is your site cared for?
- Is it current?
- Is it updated?
- Is it WordPress?
- Is it version controlled?
- Do you have continuous integration set up?
- Is any of this overkill?

### We often find that the cobbler's children have no shoes
Applying this coloquial saying to websites, many who are involved profesionally with building website omit the simple step of having their own site. Or often if we have our own site, it's woefully neglected. This means the site itself may be broken in places, the software running the site (WordPress and plugins) may be outdated (and insecure) too, not to mention the content may be incredibly stale. I've been surprised at times to realize that my own site can quickly become stale and things like where I currently work can be years behind.

### Reasons for a personal site
There are many reasons to have a personal site. I believe that though there is some work involved, it's worth the effort. Your own site is a place to be yourself and share your own ideas and thoughts. There is a whole spectrum of use cases, find your own. At the very least, it's a great way to to practice dogfooding.
