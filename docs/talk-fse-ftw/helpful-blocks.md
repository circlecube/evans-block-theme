## Helpful Blocks for a Personal Site

### Full Site Editing Helps
Along with blocks there are many updates to WordPress that help us keep our site updated, current and relevant.
- We can set auto updates (for core as well as our plugins and themes).
- We can stop the frustration of needing to integrate a "hobby" site into our standard workflow (use at your own risk).
 - Things like version control and continuous integration are great for important sites, but sometimes with a personal site or hobby site, they can be overkill and become a roadblock in keeping the site current. With FSE we can easily update templates in the theme editor so we don't even need to update source files.
- Quickly achieve simple layouts with blocks
- No need to develop anything but still have appealing and easily managable content.
- Easy blocks for content.

# The Blocks
Full Site Editing in WordPress brings us organized content blocks that we can use on our personal site. This gets us to a more aesthetic look with more accessible and usable content. There are plenty of blocks out there ready to go and even more patterns ready to insert and run with but there are still some gaps. Plenty of custom blocks fill in some of the gaps, and for some of these we donâ€™t have to develop custom blocks or even stress with complex block layouts just find a pattern.
