## Helpful Blocks for a Personal Site

### Full Site Editing Helps
Along with blocks there are many updates to WordPress that help us keep our site updated, currnet and relevant.
- We can set auto updates (for core as well as our plugins and themes)
- We can stop the frustration of needing to integrate a "hobby" site into our standard workflow (use at your own risk)
 - Things like version control and continuous integration are great for important sites, but sometimes with a personal site or hobby site, they can be overkill and become a roadblock in keeping the site current. With FSE we can easily update templates in the theme editor so we don't even need to update source files.
- Quickly achieve simple layouts with blocks
- No need to develop anything but still have appealing and easily managable content
- Easy blocks for content
