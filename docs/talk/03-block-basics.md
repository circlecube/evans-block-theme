# Block Basics

## What is a block?
A block is a single entity for structuring and interacting with content. Every paragraph, headline image or video is a block. They are interoperable and work together to tell a story, but are distinct and individual units. We have consistent tools for editing managing, and controlling them.

Say you printed a website and cut it out into rectangles of content, each one would likely be a block. Each paragraph, headline, or image but also collections of such. They can contain other blocks until essentially we get down to the basic building blocks of a site. They are interoperable and work together to tell a story, but are distinct and individual units with consistent tools for editing managing, and controlling the visual appearance. This consistent toolset is the block editor - and more and more simply known as WordPress.
