## `Blockity McBlock Block` WCEU 2022

With the recent releases of Gutenberg and Full-Site Editing WordPress is changing to the core to be block-centric. There are a lot of newer concepts regarding blocks that can be overwhelming to new users and developers as well as long time pros. From a high level we can see blocks are taking over, let’s dig a bit together to see what it all means and follow the WordPress block evolution thus far.

We have core blocks, custom blocks, dynamic blocks, reusable blocks, block widgets, block patterns, block styles, block variations, block templates, block-based themes… etc. Let’s look at these each with some content and code examples to how to deal with blocks. 

Getting familiar with all these concepts will enable you to go forth and do all the block things!
