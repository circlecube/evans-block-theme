# Block-Based Themes

A block theme is a WordPress theme with templates entirely composed of blocks so that in addition to the post content of the different post types (pages, posts, â€¦), the block editor can also be used to edit all areas of the site: headers, footers, sidebars, etc. 

A block-based theme is a theme that takes full advantage of blocks and the full site editing capabilities of WordPress 5.9. It requires a theme.json and usually includes a few templates and/or template parts. With a block theme, the user can edit all parts of their website without code

Fast to start, but takes time to master.
