# Block Vision

## The Four Phases of Gutenberg

There is a vision guiding the roadmap of WordPress development for the past number of years. The Gutenberg block editor was only step one and full-site editing is the main focus of step two. Keep this in mind as you study blocks. With this big picture perspective in mind you may see the direction things are going and how blocks are an essential part of it all. 

1. ☑ Easier Editing (2018) - Block editor in 5.0
2. ☑ Customization (2022) - FSE in 5.9
3. ☐ Collaboration (2023)
4. ☐ Multi-lingual (Future)
